  "body": "## What does it do?\r\n\r\nThis app allows you to proxy network requests and mock responses based on rule sets.\r\n\r\n## Why would you want to use it?\r\n\r\nIf you are working with APIs that are not built, or need to modify a response from an API to preview how changes to the API will affect the UI, this is the tool for you.\r\n\r\nIt is also open source and free!\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n\r\n### Set up proxy server and target\r\n\r\nOpen the settings panel:\r\n\r\n[![Settings Panel](assets/images/settings.png)](assets/images/settings.png)\r\n\r\nSet the proxy server port to the port number that you want to access the proxied site on. For example if you want to access the proxied site on `localhost:8080` input `8080`.\r\n\r\nNext set the proxy target host and port number. The proxy target can be local (in which case use `localhost`) or an external site, however the external site may block your requests. Again, set the port that you want to proxy on the target host (the standard web port is `80`).",
